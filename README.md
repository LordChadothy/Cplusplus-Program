# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created an app that allows users to be able to see how their investments will grow over a specific period of time of their choosing. This app allows users to enter in a starting amount, a monthly deposit amount, a percent for the interest rate, and the number of years it wants the app to calculate. Then, it calculates and displays two screens that show the amount at the end of each year if there was no monthly deposit versus having one.

# What did you do particularly well?
This piece of code demonstrates how detail-oriented and organized the presentation of its output is, and I think that is something that I can do particularly well if I dedicate the perfect amount of time, focus, and dedication to the project.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance this code by doing more enhanced research of the coding language and being able to implement more organized ways of producing the code and showing improvements in the practice.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
One challenging piece was the centering of the printed strings and changing how the text aligns in the output. I overcame this by doing heap-amounts of research, and with doing this I also was able to learn a few new things to help make the app a little bit more 'real' by adding a basic loading screen function to make it look like the app is running and loading the balances for the user to see. Some of the tools/resources I have used are Google, ChatGPT, YouTube videos, and asking for tips from my fellow classmates in the course.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Some of the skills from this project that I will easily be able to transfer to other projects is the skill of making the application have a smooth yet basic feel. What I mean by this is adding the presentation of a loading screen, and being able to be creative in the creation of borders in string texts. I also think that the skill of having the pure focus and dedication for the project is something I can work on and be able to flow through my future projects.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable and adaptable by using the resources given, and also reaching out and doing further research and digging to find the answers I am looking for. I also was able to oganize my code so my main was not cluttered, utilizing objects and classes as well as functions with in-line comments to be able to make the code readable for users that have never looked at code before but are able to follow through the thought process.
